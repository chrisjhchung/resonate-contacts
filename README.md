# Resonate Techinical Test 

This is my solution for the Resonate Techincal Test

## How to Run

Either view the project at: https://www.resonate-contacts-technical.web.app or use "yarn run"

If using yarn, address should be: "http://localhost:3000/"

## Features

Responsive, in the desktop mode you are able to see the contact list and the contact details on the same page. If you go into mobile view, you can only see the contact list until you select someone. 

Search, you can search for people in the contact list. The search queries the individual's name, email, website, company and location.

Avatars, random avatars are generate for each of the individuals. This is just to add a face to the names and to make the UX a littl better.

Globe, globe is used to represent where the indviduals are located. A better way of representing data. Users can experience cognitive overload if there's too much text/information. Only problem is locations are fictional, so the markers don't work as effectively as they would if they were real.
